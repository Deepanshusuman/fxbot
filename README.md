# Note

1. Don't open a new position BEFORE AND AFTER 90 minutes of the NEWS (Manual Trading)
2. Minimise fake signals by using RSI (28 AND 72) when price is continuously moving in one direction
Look for divergences: If the RSI is giving a buy signal but the price of the asset is still trending downward, this could be a false signal. Conversely, if the RSI is giving a sell signal but the price of the asset is still trending upward, this could also be a false signal.
Use the RSI in conjunction with other technical indicators: False signals can often be reduced by combining the RSI with other indicators, such as moving averages or the MACD.
